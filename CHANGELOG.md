# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — 2026-07-03
- **Renamed to amiral** (was fable-lean): the pattern is
  orchestrator/worker, not one model. The admiral doesn't row.
- Configurable fleet: `AMIRAL_BRAIN` / `AMIRAL_HANDS` env overrides —
  survives model suspensions (Fable was suspended once already) and
  renames. Aliases became functions (arg passthrough).
- Plugin packaging: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` —
  installable via `/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin install`.
- Restructure: `agents/` and `skills/` at repo root (plugin layout),
  `.claude/` mirrors kept for open-the-repo dogfooding, CI sync check.
- Safe permissions by default (no bypass flag shipped, CI-enforced),
  `docs/permissions.md` documents the full speed/safety spectrum.
- Windows: PowerShell profiles.
- `templates/verify-nextjs.sh` machine-verifiable done gate.
- `BENCHMARKS.md`: reproducible A/B/C protocol (ccusage-based).
- CI: syntax, fresh install, idempotence, CLAUDE.md preservation, clean
  uninstall, dogfood sync, manifest JSON validation, no-dangerous-flags.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-02
- Initial release as fable-lean: policy + 3 worker agents + /plan-ship
  + shell profiles + idempotent installer.
